Pyton implementation of the Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) algorithm that models student mastery of the skill being tutored.

The implementation uses Limited-memory BFGS optimization technique to minimize the objective function to arrive at the best parameters.

# Running BKT
python run.py --config ./configurations/config.json
